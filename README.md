## About

Information and uncertainty can be regarded as two sides of the same coin: 
the more uncertainty there is, the more information we gain by removing that 
uncertainty. In the context of information and probability theory, ***Entropy*** 
quantifies that uncertainty. 

The concept of entropy has its origins in 
[classical physics](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Entropy "Scholarpedia")
under the second law of thermodynamics, a law 
[considered to underpin our fundamental understanding](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/301539/the-order-of-time/9780141984964.html "Rovelli") 
of [time in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics "Wiki Time"). 
Attempting to analyse the analog world around
us requires that we measure time in discrete steps, but doing so compromises 
our ability to measure entropy accurately. Various measures have been derived 
to estimate entropy (uncertainty) from discrete time series, each seeking to 
best capture the uncertainty of the system under examination. This has resulted 
in many entropy statistics from approximate entropy and sample entropy, to
multiscale sample entropy and refined-composite multiscale cross-sample entropy.


As the number of statisitcal entropy measures grows, it becomes more difficult
to identify, contrast and compare the performance of each measure. To overcome
this, we have developed EntropyHub - an open-source toolkit designed to 
integrate the many established entropy methods into one package. The goal of 
EntropyHub is to provide a comprehensive set of functions with a simple and 
consistent syntax that allows the user to augment parameters at the command 
line, enabling a range from basic to advanced entropy methods to be implemented
with ease.

***It is important to clarify that the entropy functions herein described 
estimate entropy in the context of probability theory and information theory as
defined by Shannon, and not thermodynamic or other entropies from classical physics.***

## Installation

To install EntropyHub with Matlab, Python or Julia, please follow the instructions given in the relevant folder above.

### Requirements
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### MatLab
There are two additional MatLab toolboxes required to exploit the *full* functionality of the EntropyHub toolkit: 

__*Signal Processing Toolbox*__ and __*Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.*__

However, most functions will work without these toolboxes.

EntropyHub is intended for use with MatLab versions >= 2016a.  In some cases the toolkit may work on versions 2015a and 2015b, 
but it is not recommended to install on MatLab versions older than 2016.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Python
There are several package dependencies which will be installed alongside EntropyHub: 
Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, PyEMD, Requests

EntropyHub was designed using Python 3 and thus is not intended for use with Python 2. Python versions > 3.6 are recommended for using EntropyHub.  
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Julia
There are several package dependencies which will be installed alongside EntropyHub (if not already installed):

__*DSP, FFTW, HTTP, Random, Plots, StatsBase, StatsFuns, GroupSlices, Statistics, DelimitedFiles, Combinatorics, LinearAlgebra, Dierckx, Clustering*__

EntropyHub was designed using Julia 1.5 and is intended for use with Julia versions >= 1.2.

## Documentation & Help 

The EntropyHub Guide is a .pdf booklet written to help you use the toolkit effectively. 
(available [here](https://github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub/blob/main/EntropyHub%20Guide.pdf))

In this guide you will find descriptions of function syntax, examples of function use, and references to the source literature of each function.

The MatLab version of the toolkit has a comprehensive help section which can be accessed through the help browser.

## Functions

EntropyHub functions fall into 5 categories: 

    * Base                functions for estimating the entropy of a single univariate time series.
    * Cross               functions for estimating the entropy between two univariate time series.
    * Bidimensional       functions for estimating the entropy of a two-dimensional univariate matrix.
    * Multiscale          functions for estimating the multiscale entropy of a single univariate time series using any of the Base entropy functions.
    * Multiscale Cross    functions for estimating the multiscale entropy between two univariate time series using any of the Cross-entropy functions.

#### The following tables outline the functions available in the EntropyHub package.

*When new entropies are published in the scientific literature, efforts will
be made to incorporate them in future releases.*
