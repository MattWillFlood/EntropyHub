## Installation

There are two ways to install EntropyHub for Python. Method 1 is strongly recommended.

#### Method 1:
   1. Using `pip` in your python IDE, type:
        `pip install EntropyHub`
	
#### Method 2:
   1. Download the folder above (EntropyHub.*x.x.x*.tar.gz) and unzip it.
   2. Open a command terminal (__*cmd*__ on Windows, __*terminal*__ on Mac) or __use the Anaconda prompt
      if you use Anaconda as your python package distribution__. 
   3. In the command prompt/terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved and extracted the .tar.gz folder.
   4. Enter the following in the command line:
         `python setup.py install`
       
### System Requirements & Dependencies
  There are several package dependencies which will be installed alongside EntropyHub:             
  Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, PyEMD
  
  EntropyHub was designed using Python 3 and thus is not intended for use with Python 2.
  Python versions > 3.6 are required for using EntropyHub. 
  


## Documentation & Help 

A key advantage of EntropyHub is the comprehensive documentation available to help users to make the most of the toolkit.
One can simply access the docstrings of a function (like any Python function) by typing `help FunctionName` in the command line, 
which will print the docstrings.

All information on the EntropyHub package is detailed in the *EntropyHub Guide*, a .pdf document available [here](https://github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub/blob/main/EntropyHub%20Guide.pdf).
  
	
## Functions

EntropyHub functions fall into 5 categories: 

    * Base                functions for estimating the entropy of a single univariate time series.
    * Cross               functions for estimating the entropy between two univariate time series.
    * Bidimensional       functions for estimating the entropy of a two-dimensional univariate matrix.
    * Multiscale          functions for estimating the multiscale entropy of a single univariate time series using any of the Base entropy functions.
    * Multiscale Cross    functions for estimating the multiscale entropy between two univariate time series using any of the Cross-entropy functions.

#### The following tables outline the functions available in the EntropyHub package.

*When new entropies are published in the scientific literature, efforts will
be made to incorporate them in future releases.*
