## About

Information and uncertainty can be regarded as two sides of the same coin: 
the more uncertainty there is, the more information we gain by removing that 
uncertainty. In the context of information and probability theory, ***Entropy*** 
quantifies that uncertainty. 

The concept of entropy has its origins in 
[classical physics](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Entropy "Scholarpedia")
under the second law of thermodynamics, a law 
[considered to underpin our fundamental understanding](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/301539/the-order-of-time/9780141984964.html "Rovelli") 
of [time in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_physics "Wiki Time"). 
Attempting to analyse the analog world around
us requires that we measure time in discrete steps, but doing so compromises 
our ability to measure entropy accurately. Various measures have been derived 
to estimate entropy (uncertainty) from discrete time series, each seeking to 
best capture the uncertainty of the system under examination. This has resulted 
in many entropy statistics from approximate entropy and sample entropy, to
multiscale sample entropy and refined-composite multiscale cross-sample entropy.


As the number of statisitcal entropy measures grows, it becomes more difficult
to identify, contrast and compare the performance of each measure. To overcome
this, we have developed EntropyHub - an open-source toolkit designed to 
integrate the many established entropy methods into one package. The goal of 
EntropyHub is to provide a comprehensive set of functions with a simple and 
consistent syntax that allows the user to augment parameters at the command 
line, enabling a range from basic to advanced entropy methods to be implemented
with ease.

***It is important to clarify that the entropy functions herein described 
estimate entropy in the context of probability theory and information theory as
defined by Shannon, and not thermodynamic or other entropies from classical physics.***

## Installation

There are two ways to install EntropyHub for MatLab.

#### Method 1:
   1. Download the MatLab toolbox file (**EntropyHub.mltbx**) above.
   2. Open matlab and change the current folder to the directory where the .mltbx file is saved.
	<img src="https://github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub/blob/main/Graphics/MATLAB_README1.png" width="600" height="600"  />
	
   3. Double-click the .mltbx file to open it and click install.
	<img src="https://github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub/blob/main/Graphics/MATLAB_README2.png" />
	
#### Method 2:
   1. In MatLab, open the Add-Ons browser under the home tab by clicking 'Get Add-Ons'.
  	<img src="https://github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub/blob/main/Graphics/MATLAB_README3.png" width="1100" height="600"  />
   2. In the search bar, search for __*EntroypHub*__.
   3. Open the resulting link, and click '__*add*__' in the top-right corner.
   4. Follow the instructions to install the toolbox. __Note: You must be logged in to your MathWorks account__. 
	

### System Requirements 
  There are two additional toolboxes required to get the __*full*__ functionality of the EntropyHub toolkit:   
  *Signal Processing Toolbox* and *Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox*.
  However, most functions will work without these toolboxes.
  
  EntropyHub is intended for use with MatLab versions >= 2016a.  
  In some cases the toolkit may work on versions 2015a & 2015b. 
  However, it is not recommended to install on MatLab versions older than 2016 and should be done so with caution.


## Documentation & Help 

A key advantage of EntropyHub is the comprehensive documentation available to help users to make the most of the toolkit.
In the supplemental software section of the MatLab help browser, you can find the custom EntropyHub documentation on each EntropyHub function, complete with several examples and references to relevant scientific sources. 
To learn more about a specific function, one can do so easily from the command line by typing: `doc FunctionName`, which will display the documentation in the help browser.
For example:

`doc SampEn`     Documentation on sample entropy function

`doc XSpecEn`    Documentation on cross-spectral entropy function

`doc hXMSEn`     Documentation on hierarchical multiscale cross-entropy function

Alternatively, one can simply access the docstrings of a function (like any MatLab function) by typing `help FunctionName` in the command line, which will display the docstrings in the command window.


## Functions

EntropyHub functions fall into 5 categories: 

    * Base                functions for estimating the entropy of a single univariate time series.
    * Cross               functions for estimating the entropy between two univariate time series.
    * Bidimensional       functions for estimating the entropy of a two-dimensional univariate matrix.
    * Multiscale          functions for estimating the multiscale entropy of a single univariate time series using any of the Base entropy functions.
    * Multiscale Cross    functions for estimating the multiscale entropy between two univariate time series using any of the Cross-entropy functions.

#### The following tables outline the functions available in the EntropyHub package.

*When new entropies are published in the scientific literature, efforts will
be made to incorporate them in future releases.*
