**EntropyHub is 1 year old!**

| There has been great interest in EntropyHub in the first year since its `original publication in Plos One <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0259448>`_.
| To date, 
| * there are about 11 `publications citing EntropyHub <./Publications.html>`_, covering a broad range of scientific disciplines including neuroscience, meteorology and mathematics.
| * the `EntropyHub <https://github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub>`_ and `EntropyHub.jl <https://github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub.jl>`_ GitHub repositories have over 50 stars (42 and 11 respectively).
| * the EntropyHub MatLab toolkit has been downloaded over 600 times from the `MatLab file exchange <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/94185-entropyhub>`_!

| We would like to extend our gratitude to all those who have used EntropyHub in their work, who have provided helpful feedback, and who starred the toolkit on GitHub and MatLab.
| We plan to expand EntropyHub in the coming years and we hope that you will continue to support us in this endeavour.
| Spread the word! ;)

| At the 2022 IEEE EMBC conference in Glasgow, a symposium entitled *Recent Advances in Entropy Algorithms for Biomedical Signals: Beyond Univariate Time Series* 
| was organised by Prof. Javier Escudero and Prof. Anne Humeau-Huertier, introducing the latest methods in entropy analysis to the biomedical engineering community.
| As part of this symposium, Dr Matt Flood presented EntropyHub, introducing the audience to the advantages and benefits offered by the toolkit.

| The `2022 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Conference (EMBC) <https://embc.embs.org/2022/>`_ will take place in Glasgow from 11-15 July. As part of the conference, there will be a symposium titled *Recent Advances in Entropy Quantification Algorithms for Biomedical Signals: Beyond Univariate Time Series*, where novel appications of entropy in biomedicine will be discussed.
| Dr Matt Flood - founder and lead developer of EntropyHub - will give a presentation on *EntropyHub* as part of this symposium, introducing the toolkit, demonstrating its functionality, and revealing plans for future releases.

Read more about the conference programme `here <https://embc.embs.org/2022/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2022/04/WS_MS_SS_program.pdf>`_          

Hope to meet you there!

**Version Update - EntropyHub v0.2**

EntropyHub v0.2 includes two new bidimensional entropy methods:      

| * `Bidimensional permutation entropy (PermEn2D) <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040689>`_         
| * `Bidimensional Espinosa entropy (EspEn2D) <https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/10/1261>`_

    :height: 150px

| To bring EntropyHub to the attention of the wider scientific community, we are happy to announce that a paper describing the toolkit has been `published in PLoS One <https://www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259448>`_.
| Users of the toolkit are **required** to cite this paper if they use EntropyHub in the work.

        | *Matthew W. Flood and Bernd Grimm,*     
        | *EntropyHub: An Open-Source Toolkit for Entropic Time Series Analysis,*    
        | *PLoS One 16(11):e0259448 (2021),*
        | *DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0259448*


**Version Update - EntropyHub v0.1.1**

EntropyHub v0.1.1 includes corrections to the entropy of entropy (EnofEn) function.
Following this update, users can specify the amplitude range (xmin, xmax) over which the number of slices (S1) are partitioned.
See the source literature for more info.

**First release of EntropyHub (v0.1).**

The initial release of the EntropyHub toolkit on all platforms including:

+ `GitHub <https://www.github.com/MattWillFlood/EntropyHub>`_,     
+ `Matlab File Exchange <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/94185-entropyhub>`_,    
+ `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/EntropyHub/>`_ ,    
+ `Julia Packages <https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/EntropyHub/npy5E/>`_

As with all initial releases, there may be some bugs, typo's or other small issues that will be ironed out in time.
